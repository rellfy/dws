# Development WASM Server
Boilerplate node.js project for a static development webserver and file watcher.

This is intended for serving WASM files and copying them from the build folder to the distributable folder, although it currently works with any kind of files or project.

Change the "files", "from" and "to" keys under "watcher" in config.json to modify the folders and files that will be watched and copied between directories.
